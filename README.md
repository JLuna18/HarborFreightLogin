Created a simple framework that focuses on the Harbor Freight login page. (User must have chrome driver exe in downloads folder OR update filepath in BaseTest.java line 47.)

On test run, it will pull up the login page and call the action method that will enter the sample email address, password, and then click login (that will fail as of now since I am not using a valid account.)
